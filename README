# Example commit messages

Just a place to collect all the interesting things people do in their commit messages. To make sure GitHub displays them properly.

What is a proper commit message? Use a git client like [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com) or read [Tim Pope's article](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
